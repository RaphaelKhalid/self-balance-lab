// Bench room — a modeled 3D replica of the reference desk photo, built to be the
// surface the electronic parts sit on. This is the "in-engine reconstruction"
// path (chosen after a photo-capture came out too rough): a sage-green cabinet
// desk with a white calacatta-marble countertop, a plaster wall, a curtained
// window throwing warm light from the left, a desk lamp, and an LG-style
// front-load washer tucked under the right of the counter.
//
// Coordinate contract (1 unit = 1 cm, matching the rest of the app):
//   • the marble TOP sits at world y = 0 — the same plane creator-assembly.js
//     rests parts on (GROUND_Y = 0), so parts land flush on the counter.
//   • the build area is ~±26 units in x/z; the slab extends well past that and
//     the cabinet/washer sit below, the wall behind (−z), the window to the left.
//   • every prop is placed OUTSIDE that ±26 keep-out, so nothing a user drags a
//     component onto is ever occupied by scenery.
//
// Fidelity comes from the CC0 asset set in assets/ (see CREDITS.md): ambientCG
// PBR materials on the built surfaces, Poly Haven glTF models for the props, and
// a Poly Haven HDRI for image-based lighting. The IBL is the load-bearing part —
// marble, brushed metal and a laptop shell all read as flat plastic when there
// is nothing in the scene for them to reflect.
//
// Loading is progressive and never blocks: geometry + lights go up synchronously
// so the bench is usable immediately, then materials resolve and the props fade
// in as their glTFs arrive. A missing or failed asset degrades to the flat
// colour underneath it rather than throwing.
